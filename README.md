# Rock_Paper_Scissors
My third project from the course from The Odin Project platform. \
A simple recreation of the game Rock Paper Scissors using HTML, CSS and Javascript language. The player chooses what to play with against a computer (which makes its choice randomly) and the first to get a score of 5 wins. \
\
The appearance of the project: \
